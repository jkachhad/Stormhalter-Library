Tak would use a newly learned circular kicking technique against Varek's head, and Varek would-- he would-- he had no skills, he was just a fighter."),

		new ParagraphPageElement("Varek seemed to notice, too, his confidence building as he found openings he hadn't seen before. Tak was visibly frustrated, fighting a shadow that danced just out of reach."),
		new ParagraphPageElement("At the end of the match, Varek slipped the ring off, handing it to Tak. The two exchanged respectful nods, still unsure of the ring's power, but only bound by the thrill of roundhouse kicks for science.")
