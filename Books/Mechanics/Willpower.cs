Deep in the frozen wastes of Axe Glacier, he faced the drake. His crystal gauntlets shimmering with a blue glow as his strikes drove the beast to the brink of defeat. Victory seemed certain, for the beast was near death."),

Yet, even that wasn't the cause of his undoing. It was his anxiety- a lack of conference- but most probably low willpower, which left him vulnerable to the icy dread radiating from the drake and ensured his clumsy fall."),
