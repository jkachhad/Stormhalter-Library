While others spent days poring over texts, he would grasp the concepts in mere hours. His peers marveled at his intellect—though most regretted it when he started explaining every detail of ancient Kesmai history."),

Whenever he needed to decipher complex texts or understand ancient magic, he would drink one, and the knowledge would flow effortlessly into his mind."),
