This very anvil could forge mighty weapons- the returning axe and the silver great axe. \"No doubt, only a knight of my strength could manage this,\" he muttered, glancing around as if someone might overhear and spread the word."),

Testing his new power, he returned to the anvil, gripping it once more. This time, it lifted with ease. “See?” he grinned, even though no one was around. “Strongest knight, as always.”"),
		new ParagraphPageElement("And with that, he hauled the anvil back to Vulcan, quietly grateful the lizard wouldn't live to tell the tale of his brief struggle.")
